# GetSmells

GetSmells extracts code smells from Java source code using the 
[Understand API](https://scitools.com/support/understand-api-overview/).   

## Prequisites
GetSmells is written to work on either Windows or MacOS (tested on Windows 7 and MacOS 10.12)
* Understand: You must have [Understand](https://scitools.com/features/) installed locally to run the script.
  * It should be installed in the default location for your OS (`C:\Program Files\SciTools\` for Windows or
`/Applications/Understand.app` on MacOS); if it is not in the default location, you can modify the paths at 
the top of both `understandapi.py` and `understandcli.py`.
  * You can request 1-year educational license for Understand [here](https://scitools.com/student/)
* Python 3: The script is written in Python 3 and your 32-bit/64-bit version of Python 3 should match the 
bit-ness of your Understand install
